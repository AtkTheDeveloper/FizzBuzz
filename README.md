# FizzBuzz
This a JavaScript project I made while studying on The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com).

## The Overview
This is a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three the program prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five the program prints Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five the program prints FizzBuzz.

The code was written in the "index.html" file with all the javascript codes in the "script" tag.

## Execution / Display
This project does not have a user interface(UI). Everything is executed in the browser console. 
To view the result open up the "developer console" and click on the "console"tab.

OR

use the shortcut 
* Windows and Linux - "ctrl + shift + j".
* Mac - "cmd + option + j"
